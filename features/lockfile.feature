Feature: Creating and reading the Berkshelf lockfile
  As a user
  I want my versions to be locked even when I don't specify versions in my Berksfile
  So when I share my repository, all other developers get the same versions that I did when I installed.

  Background:
    Given the cookbook store has the cookbooks:
      | fake | 0.1.0 |
      | fake | 0.2.0 |
      | fake | 1.0.0 |
    And the cookbook store has the git cookbooks:
      | berkshelf-cookbook-fixture | 0.2.0 | 70a527e17d91f01f031204562460ad1c17f972ee |
      | berkshelf-cookbook-fixture | 1.0.0 | 919afa0c402089df23ebdf36637f12271b8a96b4 |
      | berkshelf-cookbook-fixture | 1.0.0 | a97b9447cbd41a5fe58eee2026e48ccb503bd3bc |
      | berkshelf-cookbook-fixture | 1.0.0 | 93f5768b7d14df45e10d16c8bf6fe98ba3ff809a |

  Scenario: Writing the Berksfile.lock
    Given I have a Berksfile pointing at the local Berkshelf API with:
      """
      cookbook 'fake', '1.0.0'
      """
    When I successfully run `berks install`
    Then the Lockfile should have:
      | fake | 1.0.0 |


  Scenario: Writing the Berksfile.lock when a 1.0 lockfile is present
    Given I have a Berksfile pointing at the local Berkshelf API with:
      """
      cookbook 'fake', '1.0.0'
      """
    And I write to "Berksfile.lock" with:
      """
      cookbook 'fake', :locked_version => '1.0.0'
      """
    When I successfully run `berks install`
    Then the output should warn about the old lockfile format
    And the Lockfile should have:
      | fake | 1.0.0 |


  Scenario: Writing the Berksfile.lock when a 1.0 lockfile is present and contains a full path
    Given a cookbook named "fake"

      """
      cookbook 'fake', :locked_version => '0.0.0', path: '../../tmp/aruba/fake'
      """
    When I successfully run `berks install`
    Then the output should warn about the old lockfile format
    Then the Lockfile should have:
      | fake | ./fake |


  Scenario: Writing the Berksfile.lock when a 2.0 lockfile is present
    Given I have a Berksfile pointing at the local Berkshelf API with:
      """
      cookbook 'fake', '1.0.0'
      """
    And I write to "Berksfile.lock" with:

  Scenario: Installing a cookbook with dependencies

      | dep | ~> 1.0.0 |
